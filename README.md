# 🎨 Quantum Random Art Generator

This project uses **quantum-generated randomness** via Qiskit to create unique, colorful, and abstract digital art.

Every run generates a completely different artwork with 100,000 randomly placed, colored, and shaped points—no fixed grid, full overlap, and vibrant visuals.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- **Quantum randomness** is generated using Qiskit’s Aer simulator.
- Bitstrings are converted into random positions, sizes, colors (RGBA), and shapes.
- **matplotlib** is used to draw overlapping shapes on a gradient background.

## 📦 Requirements

```bash
pip install qiskit qiskit-aer matplotlib numpy
````

---

## ▶️ Run It

```bash
python quantum_art.py
```
